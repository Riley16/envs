# obj3d

The `obj3d` package manages lists of 3D object files to present, with shuffled order and train / test sets. 

It looks for Wavefront .obj files in subdirectories organized by category names -- these .obj files can be loaded into a gi3d / eve scene for rendering.

This example is useful for seeing how to generate lists of directories and files.
