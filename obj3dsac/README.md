# obj3dsac

Obj3DSac generates renderings of 3D objects with saccadic eye movements.  Object is moved around using Sac positions relative to 0,0,0 origin and Camera is at 0,0,Z with rotations based on saccade movements.  Can save a table of saccade data plus image file names to use for offline training of models on a cluster using this code, or incorporate into an env for more dynamic uses.
