# saccade

The `saccade` package generates object trajectories and periodic saccadic eye movements, based on an abstract 2D visual environment, without any details of the objects involved.  It coordinates the timing of planning vs. execution, and updating current vs. next variables, etc, and renders everything as normalized coordinates in a table, and for visualization.
